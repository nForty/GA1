## Course Overview
Welcome to the part time Data Science course at General Assembly! We are building a global community of lifelong learners who are excited about using data to solve real world problems. 

In this program, we will use Python to explore datasets, build predictive models, and communicate data driven insights. Specifically, you will learn how to:

- Define many of the approaches and considerations that data scientists use to solve real world problems.
- Perform exploratory data analysis with powerful programmatic tools in Python.
- Build and refine basic machine learning models to predict patterns from data sets.
- Communicate data driven insights to peers and stakeholders in order to inform business decisions.

### What You Will Learn

- **Statistical Analysis with Python**: 
 - Perform visual and statistical analysis on data using Python and its associated libraries and tools.
- **Data-Driven Decision-Making**: 
 - Define and determine the trade-offs involving feature selection, model accuracy, and data quality.
- **Machine Learning & Modeling Techniques**: 
 - Explore supervised learning techniques, inlcuding classification, regression, and decision trees.
- **Visualizations & Presentations**: 
 - Create visualizations and interactive notebooks to present to industry stakeholders.


### Python Version
The curriculum materials for this course are written in Python 3.6.

## Project Structure

This course will ask you to complete a series of projects in order to practice and apply the skills covered in-class.

### Unit Projects
At the end of each Unit, you'll work on short structured projects. These activities will test your understanding of that unit’s most important concepts with in-class practice and instructor support. 

For those of you who want to go above and beyond, we’ve also included stretch options, bonus activities, and other opportunities for further reading and practice.


### Final Project

You'll also complete a final project, asking you to apply your skills to a real-world or business problem of your choice.

The capstone is an opportunity for you to demonstrate your new skills and tackle a pressing issue relevant to your life, industry, or organization. You’ll create a hypothesis, analyze internal data, and generate a working model, prototype, solution, or recommendation.

You will get structured guidance and designated time to work throughout the course. Final project deliverables include:

- **Proposal**: Describe your chosen problem and identify relevant data sets (confirming access, as needed).
- **Brief**:  Share a summary of your initial analysis and your next steps with your instructional team.
- **Report**: Submit a cleanly formatted Jupyter notebook (or other files) documenting your code and process for technical/peer stakeholders.
- **Presentation**: Present a summary of your business problem, approach, and recommendation to an audience of non-technical executive stakeholders.
